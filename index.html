			<h2> Welcome!</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Clint. I am a sophomore computer science student at Missouri State University. It was my childhood dream to be a hacker, 
					but a few bad classes and experiences made me second guess my choice. I eventually changed my mind and became a management major, 
					but I did not like the thought of ending up as an assistant manager at a retail location. So I started talking with one of my friends 
					who is a software engineer, and he told me to try my hand at programming again. I started doing the Khan Academy courses with Javascript, 
					and when I made the smiley face appear on the screen I fell in love all over again. I enrolled back in school as a CS major. I became the 
					treasurer of the ACM club we have on campus. I want to try to show others how exciting this world can be. Every day I learn something new
					and get more excited about this field. Now that you know a bit about me, I invite you to check out the rest of my site and connect with me.
