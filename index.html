			<h2> Welcome!</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Clint. I am a junior computer science student at Missouri State University. It has been my dream since I was a child to do 
					something with computers. To be more specific, when I was eight I wanted to be a hacker and a "computer repair guy." My mom helped and
					pushed me into gifted classes that taught me more about computers. I started reading books about how to hack cell phones, and I loved every minute
					of it. In high school, I took my first official hardware class, and I bombed it. It was a junior level course, and I took it as a freshman who
					who was not ready for the course load. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					After that I kind of gave up on that dream and chose another one based on an aptitude test I took for school. the test said I would be good as a 
					lawyer or an entrepreneur. I thought, why not both. I started taking business electives, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. During this time my family 
					bought an auto shop business, and during summers and breaks I would help my brother out in the garage while working in the office. This experience 
					really pushed me into my first major in college, management. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I did two years as a management major until I saw where a lot of other business majors ended up working as assistant managers at a retail location; 
					which was not what they wanted to do. I started	really questioning my life. Not only was I not sure what I wanted to do, but I had started to come 
					to the realization I did not believe in a god. It seemed like everything I thought I knew I wanted from life was wrong. I took some time off of
					college while I sorted things out. Between my two jobs I worked 60+hour weeks, but I still felt bored with life. So I was talking to one of my 
					friends about it, and he recommended I try my hand at programming. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I started doing some courses on Khan Academy with Javascript, and when I made the smiley face appear on the screen I felt a rush. I 
					wanted more. I was in love all over again. I kept doing assignment after assignment all on different websites in different languages. I felt my 
					calling. It was all great, until I hit a roadblock. There was an animation of a ball bouncing I was working on, but in order to do it I needed to 
					create a function that used a parabola formula; this was an issue because I did not pay attention in my math classes. So, I decided to re enroll back 
					in school as a CS major. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					
					In the time since I have learned a lot and became the treasurer of the ACM club we have on campus.  On top of wanting to 
					further my own interests and skills I also want to show others how exciting the world of computer science can be. I will never forget the first time
					I wrote my first piece of HTML, I had the biggest smile on my face and was literally shaking with excitement. It seems like every day I learn something new
					and get more excited about this field. Now that you know a bit about me, I invite you to check out the rest of my site and connect with me.
