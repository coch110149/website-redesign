			<h2> About Me:</h2>
			<p> I was born in Fremont, CA. My mom and I moved to Kentucky where I stayed until the 3rd Grade. 
				She met my dad when I was 8. They married. We moved in together in Louisiana. I finished Middle school there. We moved back to 
				California; where I went to high school. I have visited Ireland and the UK, and loved it. I moved to Springfield, MO to go to 
				college majoring in business. I met some friends here, and I started questioning life a lot. Eventually I reached a conclusion
				and I became an atheist and was kicked out of my christian college for it. I moved back with my parents in Kentucky and worked 
				two jobs. Those two jobs showed me where most management majors end up. I started to questioning my life direction again. I 
				reached out to a friend of mine, and he told me to try programming, since it was my childhood dream. So I did and fell in love with it. 
				I moved back to Springfield with my girlfriend and enrolled in school again, this time as a computer science major. I married my 
				girlfriend. She is now putting me through college and I am working as hard as I can to become a software engineer. I also got a job
				with the networking department of my school, and I love working with computer guys. I really feel like I've found my place
