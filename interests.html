			<h2> Interests!</h2>
				<p class = "small"> 
					There are a lot of things that I like. These things shape who I am as a person. I have included a few of them on this page. 
				</p>
				<div class = "entry">
				<h3> Travel </h3>
					<p>
						When I was a child, my mom would travel a lot for work. The company she worked for built Lowe&#8217;s stores around the country, and she would
						supervise the progress. She also took her boss&#8217;s classic cars to car shows around the country. Most of these trip I got to go with her. 
						Because of this, I have traveled most of the country and have developed a love for the uniqueness of the different parts of this country. 
						I saw more of the country when I moved from Louisiana to California; my family drove around the country and went to 21 different states. 
						The beauty this country offers is underappreciated. In high school, I traveled to the UK and Ireland, and I fell in love with Dublin. 
						I would not mind moving there. It&#8217;s hard to pick favorite places, but I really enjoyed:
					</p>
						<ul>   
							<li> Montana, it was so quiet </li>
							<li> Philadelphia, because of the history </li>
							<li> Grand Canyon, seeing it in person is breathtaking </li>
							<li> Hawaii, because, well, Hawaii.  </li>
							<li> Colorado (in summer), the mountains and the climate are perfect. </li>
							<li> Dublin, Wales, and Glasgow. </li>
							<li> Big Springs, Van Buren, Mo </li>
							<li> San Francisco. Even though this is home. I still love it here </li>
						</ul>

				<div class = "entry">
					<h3> Technology </h3>
						<p>
							As you might have guessed I am a big fan of Technology. I am an Android fan, but I don&#8217;t hate Apple. I am also a big fan of robotic. 
							I cannot wait for self driving cars, I am working on building a robot that will open and close windows and blinds for me based on interior 
							vs exterior temperature and lighting. I joke with my wife that instead of children, we can just make robots. She does not think that is 
							funny. I&#8217;m also big into energy conservation. We ride our bikes almost everywhere in town and we do our laundry and dishes by hand. I am 
							slowly converting what we can in our apartment over to solar power; so far it&#8217;s been lighting, phones, and fans. I&#8217;m afraid to put a 
							panel in that is too big because of vandalism. Of course I love programming and computers, and as you might know this passion designates me 
							as the family tech support agent, but it&#8217;s okay I enjoy it.

				<h3> Cycling</h3>
					<p>	
						Over the last year, I have become a <em>HUGE</em> fan and advocate of cycling. I bought my first bike shop bike 7/3/14. It is a Trek FX 7.2 with disc brakes. 
						It may not be top of the line, but I love it. It has become my primary form of transportation. It has enabled me to see neighboring towns to me. I have put 
						several thousand miles on it since I got it, but she is still running strong. I plan on keeping it until I graduate college, and then I want a touring bike. 
						Amy and I have been talking about touring parts of the country on a bike, but our current bikes are not the best for that. We do have some overnight camping 
						trips planned when it cools down a bit. I will keep you updated on those. 
					</p>

				<div class = "entry">
				<h3> Cosplay</h3>
					<p>	
						Last year for halloween, I finally did something I had been talking about for a while; tried cosplay. I went with my favorite marvel character, Deadpool. At 
						almost a year later, I&#8217;m almost done with it. I am also working on an Ood, from Doctor Who, it will be called Ood gamma. I&#8217;m also in the planning stages of 
						doing a sith cosplay. 
					</p>

				<div class = "entry">
				<h3> Other interests</h3>
					<p>	
						This is not a complete list, but I&#8217;m also into:
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Star Wars </li>
							<li>Doctor Who </li>
							<li>Pok&egrave;mon </li>
							<li>Marvel </li>
