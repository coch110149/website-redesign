						is my first problem -> idea -> solution I worked on for myself. The idea came from 
						how Amy and I do our grocery shopping. We have a Google sheet that we use to plan out our meals for 
						the month, and when we are at the store we track the cost of each item. The hardest part for us was 
						actually coming up with the meals to make that month that would not take us over budget. That is 
						where I had the idea for a simple program to do it for us. We can feed (no pun intended) it the meals we 
						have made and the meals we plan on making with an estimated cost of each and tell the program we want <em> x </em> 
						number of meals and only want to spend <em> y </em> dollars. The program will then give us a list of meals, 
						the total cost, and the ingredients needed to make them.
