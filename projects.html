					This is where I will post my projects I am working on. Most of these will be out of class assignments, but if there is a fun or intereststing project for class
					I will post it too. These are all open source. So take a look at the github link, play with the code, and if you want you can sent a pull request.

					This is an interesting project. This is a friend of mine's project. My ACM
					chapter was looking for some fun projects to take on, and I asked him if he had anything we could help him complete. He showed me this project. Which as a google voice 
					user I think it is a cool idea. I am currently trying to learn more about Java so I can start working on it, but hopefully the club will start working on it soon.

						<p>
							 I made this site before knowing anything about CSS. I started applying 
							what things as I learned them, but I decided it was easier to just start over blank than to try and fix everything I did on it. It will still have a special place in my heart
							because it was my first.

					<p>	
						This project is my first problem -> idea -> solution I worked on for myself. The idea came from 
						how Amy and I do our grocery shopping. We have a Google sheet that we use to plan out our meals for 
						the month, and when we are at the store we track the cost of each item. The hardest part for us was 
						actually coming up with the meals to make that month that would not take us over budget. That is 
						where I had the idea for a simple program to do it for us. We can feed (no pun intended) it the meals we 
						have made and the meals we plan on making with an estimated cost of each and tell the program we want <em> x </em> 
						number of meals and only want to spend <em> y </em> dollars. The program will then give us a list of meals, 
						the total cost, and the ingredients needed to make them.
