					This is where I will post my projects I am working on. Most of these will be out of class assignments, but if there is a fun or intereststing project for class
					I will post it too. These are all open source. So take a look at the github link, play with the code, and if you want you can send a pull request.

				<h3> <a href = "https://github.com/coch110149/Tumbleroll-game" target = "_blank"> 10/02/2015</a></h3>
				<p>
					A game that allows two players to play against each other. A player rolls the die and moves that number of spaces, but if the player lands on an occupied 
					space the player that was there already must tumble down the board. First player to reach 20 wins

				<h3> <a href = "https://github.com/coch110149/IntToWord-codingChallenge" target = "_blank"> 09/25/2015</a></h3>
				<p>
					I met with a representative with a Classy Llama, a local design company, and I was given a coding challenge. The challenge said to write a function that takes 
					an int from 0 to 9,999 and returns the word representation of that int. For example, 1234 would return one thousand thirty-four. This was my first experience with 
					PHP, and it was a blast. I cannot wait to get into it more.

				<h3> <a href = "https://github.com/coch110149/passwordMakingScript" target = "_blank"> 09/23/2015</a></h3>
				<p>
					My family always relies on me for tech support, but I can only do remote help because we live so far from each other. When I am not there to force them to come 
					up with secure passwords; they simply will not do it. I wrote this script to make it easy for them. They run the executable and get a text document back with a 
					secure password.

				<h3> <a href = "https://github.com/coch110149/Android-Google-Voice-Locations" target = "_blank"> 09/09/2015</a></h3>
				<p>
					This is an interesting project. This is a friend of mine's project. My ACM
					chapter was looking for some fun projects to take on, and I asked him if he had anything we could help him complete. He showed me this project. Which as a google voice 
					user I think it is a cool idea. I am currently trying to learn more about Java so I can start working on it, but hopefully the club will start working on it soon.

					<h3> <a href = "https://github.com/coch110149/Website-for-Clint" target = "_blank"> 09/06/2015</a> </h3>
						<p>
							 I made this site before knowing anything about CSS. I started applying 
							what things as I learned them, but I decided it was easier to just start over blank than to try and fix everything I did on it. It will still have a special place in my heart
							because it was my first.

				<h3> <a href = "https://github.com/coch110149/MealListMaker" target = "_blank"> 05/08/2015 </a></h3>
					<p>	
						This project is my first problem -> idea -> solution I worked on for myself. The idea came from 
						how Amy and I do our grocery shopping. We have a Google sheet that we use to plan out our meals for 
						the month, and when we are at the store we track the cost of each item. The hardest part for us was 
						actually coming up with the meals to make that month that would not take us over budget. That is 
						where I had the idea for a simple program to do it for us. We can feed (no pun intended) it the meals we 
						have made and the meals we plan on making with an estimated cost of each and tell the program we want <em> x </em> 
						number of meals and only want to spend <em> y </em> dollars. The program will then give us a list of meals, 
						the total cost, and the ingredients needed to make them.
